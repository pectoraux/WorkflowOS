/**
 * V2-009 — Scheduling + Events + Placement: the public module surface
 * (barrel).
 *
 * Structure (the workflow-runs/computer-agent precedent): public contracts in
 * `types.ts`; the deterministic derivations, the pure timezone engine, the
 * schedule derivations, the typed event schemas, the delivery policy, the
 * placement projection, the frozen registry vocabulary snapshot, the
 * PostgreSQL store and the service in `internal/*` (private — the
 * architecture boundary suite enforces that nothing outside this directory
 * reaches into `internal/`).
 *
 * Consumers (the API route, the tests, later Work Orders) import ONLY from
 * this barrel.
 *
 * BOUNDARY REMINDER (constitution §2/§4/§5/§7/§11/§12/§16/§19/§21 +
 * V2-CTRL-003):
 *   - Workflow/WorkflowVersion/installation semantics are V2-002's (consumed
 *     read-only for pin resolution; the WorkflowDeployment pins the SAME
 *     immutable version identity);
 *   - WorkflowIR semantics + the semantic digest are V2-003's; the compiled
 *     plan is V2-007's (consumed for placement compatibility);
 *   - Run lifecycle/evidence is V2-005's: triggered runs are created ONLY
 *     through the merged run service's requestRun boundary (create-or-
 *     converge); this module never starts/completes runs or records run
 *     evidence;
 *   - Node/capability/placement matching is V2-004's (the merged matcher is
 *     the only placement authority);
 *   - computer-use execution is V2-008's (not imported here — the trigger
 *     layer hands runs to the run boundary; no second engine);
 *   - attestation semantics are V2-014's (no attestation concepts here);
 *   - PostgreSQL is the authority: no in-memory trigger state is a source of
 *     truth; PGlite is the Postgres-compatible test/dev implementation of
 *     the same single persistence boundary.
