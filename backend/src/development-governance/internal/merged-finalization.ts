/**
 * WORK-052 — the post-merge finalization audit (§34.8; ADR-0007).
 *
 * The completion rule (`governance-model.json` `completionRule`) defines the
 * completion CONDITION — the architect's merge is the only completion event.
 * The post-merge review of PR #62 (merged as `47615c2` while the canonical
 * state still recorded WORK-052 `in_flight`) exposed the operational gap: a
 * condition without a finalization mechanism leaves the repository able to
 * hold a FALSE program state. This module closes that gap from the evidence
 * side: it binds the canonical state to the repository's own merge history
 * and reports every finalization gap.
 *
 *   MERGED-BUT-NOT-COMPLETE — the architect merged the PR (merge evidence in
 *                             the first-parent history of main) while the work
 *                             order is still in_flight/pending: a merged Work
 *                             Order cannot remain represented as in_flight in
 *                             canonical state.
 *   EVIDENCE-MISMATCH       — a complete record whose mergedAs.mergeCommit is
 *                             not the actual merge commit.
 *
 * Merge-evidence shapes recognized on main's first-parent chain:
 *   - `Merge pull request #N from …` — the classic merge commit (bound by PR
 *     number);
 *   - `WORK-NNN: …` — the architect's direct/squash merge convention (bound
 *     by work-order id; PR #62 merged this way as `47615c2`).
 *
 * PURE over its inputs; the only I/O is
 * {@link MergeEvidenceUnavailableError} fail-closed evidence collection from
 * repository-resident git history — never an external service.
