/**
 * WORK-051 — Architecture Governance and Checkpoints (public contract).
 *
 * The checkpoint capability is an APPLICATION-LAYER ORCHESTRATOR that lives
 * at `src/architecture-checkpoints/` (mirrors the §34 benchmark + WORK-033
 * execution-policy pattern: NOT an 18th frozen module — it CONSUMES the
 * frozen modules via their public barrels).
 *
 * Boundary contract (issue #51 + design
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-architecture-governance-checkpoints-design.md):
 *
 *   /architecture  owns ArchitectureVersions + the assertion set (read here
 *                  through the public barrel's ArchitectureAssertionReader).
 *   /verification  owns ALL durable evidence — checkpoint results are
 *                  persisted through the existing VerificationService
 *                  contract (NO parallel evidence store).
 *   /workflows     owns lifecycle state — the checkpoint NEVER mutates
 *                  workflow state; it returns a gating result the workflow
 *                  orchestrator consumes before performing the legal
 *                  transition.
 *   /reviews       remains the semantic architectural authority — mechanical
 *                  checkpoints reduce review burden, they do not replace
 *                  judgment.
 *
 * The subsystem imports from @modules/* (public barrels only — never
 * internal/) and @platform/*. It never issues SQL, never stores credentials,
 * and holds NO mutation-capable port over architecture, workflow, or
 * verification state (the reader ports below are structurally narrowed —
 * there is no method to call even if an implementation wanted to).
