-- WORK-046 — Multi-Agent Delegation: the durable COORDINATION substrate.
--
-- The delegation layer is COORDINATION, NOT AUTHORITY (spec/work-orders/
-- WORK-046.md). These tables are coordination data referencing EXISTING
-- identities — they are NOT a second Work Item lifecycle, NOT execution
-- history authority (wfos_executions is), NOT role authority (the WORK-045
-- static catalog is), and NOT workflow state (wfos_workflow_executions is).
--
-- Identities:
--   plan  — ONE logical plan per (work_item_id, plan_key): the same
--           delegation request converges on ONE authoritative plan; two
--           concurrent creators serialize through the UNIQUE constraint.
--   unit  — ONE logical unit per (plan_id, unit_key): the stable delegation
--           identity (role assignment pinned at creation; stable across
--           retries).
--   attempt — ONE delegated EXECUTION per attempt: execution_id is UNIQUE
--           (an existing wfos_executions execution identity belongs to at
--           most ONE delegation attempt) and (unit_id, attempt_no) is
--           UNIQUE. A retry allocates a NEW attempt (a NEW execution
--           identity); the unit + role identity stay stable.
--
-- Statuses are COORDINATION vocabulary, structurally disjoint from the
-- frozen WorkflowState set (no hidden lifecycle state):
--   plan.status    active | completed | abandoned
--   unit.status    pending | dispatched | succeeded | failed | unresolved | cancelled
--   attempt.outcome NULL (in flight) | succeeded | failed | unresolved
--
-- NOTE ON NUMBERING: this migration is 0057 although main's last migration
-- is 0051 — 0052–0056 are reserved for the pending WORK-051 branch (PR #52).
-- Migrations apply in filename order; both merge orders stay clean.

-- INTERRUPTION RACE GUARD (architectural correction): an interrupt changes

-- holding a stale in-memory 'pending' snapshot, so the dispatch transaction
-- MUST re-check the plan authority at the exact durable-intent boundary.
-- Locking the plan row here serializes that check against interruptPlan's
-- UPDATE: either dispatch commits its durable intent while the plan is still
-- active (after which the execution is considered in-flight and interruption
-- does not touch it), or the trigger rejects the new attempt after the plan
-- has become abandoned. This closes the window where a stale pending unit
-- could otherwise start after interruption.
