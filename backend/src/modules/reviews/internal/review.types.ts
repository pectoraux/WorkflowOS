/**
 * Reviews domain types (REVIEW-001, REVIEW-002).
 *
 * The /reviews module owns Architect Review + Review Finding persistence and
 * semantics. It does NOT:
 * - own architect execution (that's /llm — LLM-002);
 * - own canonical workflow state (that's /workflows);
 * - own verification semantics / evidence (that's /verification);
 * - own Work Item/Work Order (that's /work-items);
 * - own ArchitectureVersion (that's /architecture).
 *
 * Boundary ownership (frozen architecture §6, §19, §20; architecture-lock.md §61):
 *   /llm executes architect reasoning → /reviews persists the verdict + findings
 *   → /workflows consumes the public ReviewResult to drive state transitions.
 *
 * Traceability chain (frozen architecture §19, §25, §35):
 *   Review → Work Item → ArchitectureVersion → Architecture → Project → Organization
 *   Review → Work Order (where applicable)
 *   Review → Architect Execution (where the review originated from /llm)
 *
 * Review history / correction cycles (architecture §20, FINDING-AC-03):
 *   Reviews are append-oriented/historical. A finalized review's outcome is
 *   immutable. A later review's findings may reference the prior finding that
 *   caused the correction cycle via causedByFindingId.

// --- Review verdicts (canonical, frozen architecture §19) ---
//
// These are the CANONICAL REVIEW VERDICTS — distinct from canonical workflow
// states. The mapping from verdict → workflow transition is /workflows'
// responsibility (WORK-018), NOT /reviews':
//
//   APPROVE                       → workflow proceeds to APPROVED → MERGED
//   REQUEST_CHANGES               → workflow transitions to CHANGES_REQUESTED → IMPLEMENTING
//   ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE_REQUIRED  → workflow transitions to ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE_REQUEST
//   IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKED        → workflow may set IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKED state
//
// /reviews does NOT define a competing WorkflowState enum. The verdict is a
// review-domain result; the workflow state is a workflows-domain result.

export type ReviewVerdict =
  | 'APPROVE'
  | 'REQUEST_CHANGES'
  | 'ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE_REQUIRED'
  | 'IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKED';

// --- Review lifecycle status ---
//
// Distinct from the verdict. A review starts 'in_progress' and is finalized
// to 'completed' with an immutable outcome.

export type ReviewStatus = 'in_progress' | 'completed';

// --- Reviewer/actor source ---
//
// Distinguishes the origin of the review: LLM architect execution vs manual
// human reviewer vs agent-reported. Used for audit traceability
// (architecture §19, §31).

// --- Finding severity (frozen field name; enum values defined by WORK-016) ---
//
// The frozen spec does not enumerate severity values — only the field name
// 'severity' is frozen (architecture §20). WORK-016 defines a conservative
// set: blocker / major / minor / info.

export type FindingSeverity = 'blocker' | 'major' | 'minor' | 'info';

// --- Finding disposition (for correction-cycle traceability) ---
//
// The frozen spec requires findings to persist so correction cycles remain
// traceable (architecture §20, FINDING-AC-03). A finding's disposition
// tracks whether the correction has been addressed.
