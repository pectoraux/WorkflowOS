/**
 * Architecture domain types (ARCH-001..004, ARCH-AC-01..03, ARCH2/3/4-AC-01..03).
 *
 * The /architecture module owns the runtime project-specific Architecture,
 * ArchitectureVersion, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and Architecture
 * Change Requests. This is distinct from the frozen repository governance
 * documents (/spec/architecture.md, /spec/architecture-lock.md) which are NOT
 * modified by this module.
 *
 * Architecture is a versioned project artifact (spec/architecture.md §9).
 * Lifecycle: DRAFT → FROZEN → SUPERSEDED. A frozen version is immutable
 * (enforced at the persistence level, not just the service layer).
 *
 * Tenant scoping is inherited through the project's owning organization

//
// An Architecture Assertion is a version-scoped architectural rule owned by
// /architecture and attached to an IMMUTABLE ArchitectureVersion. It describes
// a condition that must remain true for implementations governed by that
// version (issue #51; design §4.1).
//
// Immutability is TWO-layered and persistence-enforced (migration 0052):
//  1. ROW immutability — assertion rows are append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE
//     trigger-rejected at the PostgreSQL level).
//  2. SET immutability — assertions attach only to DRAFT versions; a FROZEN
//     version's assertion set is closed. Intentional change follows the
//     Architecture Change Request → new immutable version path (ARCH-004).
//
// The checkpoint subsystem (application layer) READS assertions through the
// public barrel's {@link ArchitectureAssertionReader}; it can never create,
// mutate, or remove them.
