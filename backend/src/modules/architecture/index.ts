/**
 * architecture module — public interface.
 *
 * Canonical name: /architecture
 * Responsibility (spec/architecture.md): Architecture Management, ADRs,
 * Architecture Change Requests, Architecture Versions.
 *
 * This file is the ONLY surface other modules may import. Files under
 * `internal/` are private to this module; cross-module imports of
 * `internal/` are forbidden and enforced statically (PLAT-AC-02).
 *
 * WORK-005: implements the runtime project-specific /architecture domain
 * (ARCH-001..004). This is distinct from the frozen repository governance
 * documents (/spec/architecture.md, /spec/architecture-lock.md) which are NOT
 * modified. The runtime model coexists with the frozen governance model.
 *
 * Lifecycle: DRAFT → FROZEN → SUPERSEDED. A frozen version is immutable
 * (persistence-enforced, not just a service check). A new immutable version is
 * created only from an approved Architecture Change Request.
