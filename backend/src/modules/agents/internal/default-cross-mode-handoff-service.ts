/**
 * WORK-042: DefaultCrossModeHandoffService.
 *
 * The cross-mode handoff boundary. ONE logical ExecutionRecord is preserved
 * (identity); the service transitions the existing record's `mode` + `status`
 * + the mode-specific authoritative fields, dispatches through the EXISTING
 * NativeExecutionProvider / ExternalExecutionProvider, and writes the
 * append-only handoff log row + an audit event.
 *
 * FLOW (per the WORK-042 plan):
 *   1. resolve record (findByExecutionId) -> 404 if absent.
 *   2. validate targetMode is native|external.
 *   3. validate targetMode != record.mode (a handoff must change mode).
 *   4. validate eligibility (the from-mode + status preconditions).
 *   5. idempotency check (findByIdempotencyKey + findByExecutionId).
 *   6. policy-gate (external -> agentPolicyEngine.evaluateExternalHandoff;
 *      native -> executionPolicy native_execution_allowed + registry native
 *      provider availability — fail-closed).
 *   7. resolve provider/model for the target.
 *   8. reserve + claim: INSERT append-only handoff log row (previous_*
 *      snapshot + idempotency_key) AND claim the durable obligation in ONE
 *      transaction (PR #46 round 4 — the claim is the serialization
 *      boundary shared by the caller + the relay; closes the boot-sweep
 *      race between reserve and the caller's mutation). Catch 23505 ->
 *      converge (same key, claimed:false) / reject (diff key). migration
 *      0043's AFTER INSERT trigger writes the durable handoff obligation
 *      ATOMICALLY with the reserve INSERT; migration 0044 adds the claim
 *      columns + the conditional UPDATE claim predicate.
 *   9-10. mutate record (transitionMode mode+status) THEN drive the session
 *        through the EXISTING non-terminal path THEN dispatch (provider
 *        submit) THEN updateStatus (provider outcome) — crash-safety: a crash
 *        after mutate but before dispatch is recoverable (retry sees the
 *        mutated record + re-dispatches); a crash after dispatch converges
 *        (the agentRunRepository.findByExecutionId guard skips a second
 *        AgentRun for external->native; the ExternalExecutionProvider
 *        regenerates the package idempotently for native->external).
 *        PR #46 round 4: the claim covers this whole critical section — a
 *        concurrent reconcile sees a CLAIMED obligation + returns early
 *        (NO re-mutate, NO re-dispatch). The `finally` releases the claim
 *        (success OR failure).
 *   10b. enqueue the durable relay job (PR #46 round 3 — the concurrency fix:
 *        enqueue AFTER the mutation+dispatch+session, NOT before — a live
 *        WorkerHost that picks up the job sees a COMPLETE handoff + the
 *        reconcile is a no-op discharge; the boot sweep is the recovery path
 *        for a crash between reserve and this enqueue).
 *   11. audit (best-effort — try/catch, never breaks flow).
 *   12. return { executionId, handoff, record (re-fetch) }.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY: the handoff log table UNIQUE(execution_record_id) is the hard
 * fence against a SECOND handoff for the same execution. The durable claim/
 * lease (migration 0044) is the serialization boundary for the
 * mutation/session/dispatch critical section — the caller + the relay
 * reconcile use the SAME claim primitive so a concurrent boot-sweep/relay
 * cannot re-mutate + re-dispatch the same obligation while the caller holds
 * the claim (PR #46 round 4 — the architect's required durable serialization
 * boundary). A crashed owner's lease auto-expires (claim_expires_at < NOW())
 * + the boot sweep reclaims + recovers.
 *
 * PR #46 round 5 (the lease-ownership + lease-expiry fixes):
 *   - the claim owner is a UNIQUE per-invocation identity
 *     (`<role-prefix>:<uuid>` — never a shared role constant): a stale
 *     invocation's owner+epoch-guarded `finally` release can NEVER clear a
 *     newer owner's live claim;
 *   - the lease is renewed by a HEARTBEAT (every claimLeaseMs/3) across the
 *     ENTIRE critical section — a LIVE owner's lease cannot expire
 *     mid-flight (a slow provider dispatch no longer forfeits the claim);
 *   - every claim increments claim_epoch (the fencing token — migration
 *     0045): a STALLED owner (heartbeat dead) whose expired lease was
 *     reclaimed fails its phase-boundary fence checks (the renewal's
 *     owner+epoch predicate returns 0 rows) + its discharge is REJECTED at
 *     the DB — it aborts with 'claim-fence-lost' BEFORE further side
 *     effects (zero duplicate dispatch / session transitions);
 *   - a CRASHED owner's lease still auto-expires + the boot sweep reclaims
 *     + recovers (the round-4 semantics are preserved).
 *
 * PR #46 round 6 (the side-effect-boundary fencing fix): the round-5
 * phase-boundary `ensureFence()` runs BEFORE the side-effecting provider
 * call, not ATOMICALLY with it — an owner that passed the pre-call check
 * and then stalled (heartbeat dead) could resume after a reclaim and
 * complete its ALREADY-STARTED dispatch (a second authoritative provider
 * operation). The DISPATCH SIDE-EFFECT BOUNDARY itself is now fenced
 * (migration 0046's dispatch gate on the obligation row):
 *   - beginFencedDispatch: the lease fence (owner + epoch) evaluated
 *     ATOMICALLY with the durable dispatch intent, BEFORE the provider
 *     submit — a fenced-out actor never reaches the provider;
 *   - completeFencedDispatch: the gate CAS AND the authoritative outcome
 *     write on wfos_executions in ONE transaction — a stale actor's
 *     resumed, already-started dispatch CANNOT commit its outcome (0 rows →
 *     rollback → NO write: neither a duplicate success NOR a failure
 *     clobber);
 *   - the provider call itself may still be duplicated across a stall (a
 *     non-transactional submit cannot be un-sent), but it converges to ONE
 *     authoritative operation: the external provider is a deterministic
 *     pure function (the outcome write is the authoritative operation —
 *     fence-gated); the native gateway's wfos_agent_runs.execution_id
 *     UNIQUE makes the run structurally singular + the colliding submit
 *     CONVERGES to the existing run (conflict recovery) instead of writing
 *     a stale failure;
 *   - an interrupted in-flight gate (a crashed/stalled owner that crossed
 *     but never completed) is TAKEN OVER by the next (monotonic) lease —
 *     liveness: an interrupted dispatch can never deadlock the gate.
 *
 * PR #46 round 7 (the provider-operation exactly-once boundary): the round-6
 * review REJECTED the "the provider call may still be duplicated, but it
 * converges to ONE authoritative operation" framing — the DB outcome being
 * singular does NOT make the PROVIDER OPERATION exactly-once: the submit runs
 * OUTSIDE the DB transaction, so a lease reclaimed while the first submit is
 * still in flight let the reclaiming owner's take-over re-dispatch start a
 * SECOND provider operation (two in-flight submits for ONE logical handoff).
 * The correction adopts the architect's contract option 1 — the exactly-once
 * side-effect boundary via a DURABLE IDEMPOTENCY KEY (migration 0047):
 *   - the dispatch derives `cross-mode-dispatch-<handoffId>` — from the
 *     LOGICAL HANDOFF IDENTITY ONLY (NEVER the volatile lease owner/epoch),
 *     so the original owner, a reclaiming owner, + a crash-recovery
 *     re-dispatch all derive the SAME key;
 *   - the key is recorded DURABLY, atomically with the gate-open
 *     (beginFencedDispatch's UPDATE also sets dispatch_idempotency_key), and
 *     stamped on the submitted ExecutionTask;
 *   - the provider boundary CONVERGES same-key submits onto ONE operation:
 *     the ExternalExecutionProvider's keyed registry returns the REGISTERED
 *     (first-generation) submission; the NativeExecutionProvider converges a
 *     keyed dispatch whose run already exists onto that run (no gateway
 *     call, no second adapter invocation) + a creation collision converges
 *     the loser to the winner's run — the convergence is a CONTRACT, not a
 *     determinism accident;
 *   - the round-6 fence + gate are RETAINED: even a converged submission
 *     commits its outcome ONLY through completeFencedDispatch (the lease
 *     owner wins; a stale actor's completion affects 0 rows).
 *
 * This file is private to /agents (PLAT-AC-02). It composes the EXISTING
 * boundaries — it is NOT an ExecutionService, it NEVER creates a second
 * ExecutionRecord, and it NEVER touches wfos_workflow_*, wfos_verification_*,
 * wfos_reviews_*.
