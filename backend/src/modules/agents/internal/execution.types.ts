/**
 * WORK-027: Execution provider abstraction — public contract types.
 *
 * WorkflowOS supports two ways to execute the same Work Order:
 *
 *   NATIVE:    WorkflowOS → provider API → agent/model → GitHub → CI →
 *              Verification → Architect Review.
 *   EXTERNAL:  WorkflowOS → external execution package → WorkflowOS Companion
 *              extension → ChatGPT / Claude / Z.ai native UI → GitHub → CI →
 *              Verification → Architect Review.
 *
 * Both modes use the SAME authoritative WorkflowOS objects (Project,
 * Architecture, Requirements, Criteria, Work Item, Work Order,
 * ImplementationContext, PR/CI evidence, Verification, Review, Audit). The
 * execution mode is an implementation detail behind the ExecutionProvider
 * boundary.
 *
 * Authority rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
 *   - The canonical Work Item workflow state machine remains owned by
 *     /workflows. Execution state (below) is a SEPARATE state machine that
 *     describes only the execution record itself.
 *   - Verification semantics remain owned by /verification; reviews by
 *     /reviews; PR/merge authority remains the GitHub webhook. An external
 *     execution can REPORT commit/branch/PR/test summaries, but it can never
 *     declare MERGED / VERIFIED / PASS / APPROVED.
 *   - ExternalExecutionPackage contains NO secrets of any kind (no GitHub
 *     tokens, no LLM API keys, no Vercel tokens, no webhook secrets).
 *
 * This file is private to /agents (PLAT-AC-02). The barrel exports the types
 * below; concrete implementations stay in internal/.

   * PR #46 round 7 (the provider-operation exactly-once boundary): the
   * DURABLE idempotency key for THIS provider dispatch — derived from the
   * LOGICAL HANDOFF IDENTITY (`cross-mode-dispatch-<handoffId>`), NEVER from
   * the volatile lease owner/epoch, so every actor that dispatches the same
   * logical handoff (the original owner, a reclaiming owner, a crash-recovery
   * re-dispatch) derives the SAME key.
   *
   * THE PROVIDER CONTRACT (the architect's round-7 option 1 — the exactly-once
   * side-effect boundary): when a task carries this key, `submit()` MUST NOT
   * start a SECOND provider operation for the same key — a same-key submit
   * CONVERGES to the operation the first submit already started (it returns
   * that operation's submission — awaiting it when still in flight — exactly
   * like a Stripe-style `Idempotency-Key`). The correctness of a keyed
   * dispatch may never depend on provider determinism/purity: the provider
   * must return the REGISTERED operation, not a re-computed lookalike.
   *
   * PR #46 round 8 (the DURABLE idempotency boundary): the keyed operation
   * registry is DURABLE — it survives provider-instance loss, process loss,
   * and reclaim-driven re-dispatch by any other actor. A same-key submit
   * through a FRESH provider instance resolves to the SAME operation the
   * original instance opened:
   *
   *   - EXTERNAL mode: the durable provider-operation ledger is
   *     `wfos_execution_provider_operations` (migrations 0048 + 0049). The
   *     ledger ROW is the operation (idempotency_key PRIMARY KEY — ONE row
   *     per key); its states are PENDING / COMPLETED / FAILED + the stored
   *     operation/result (submission_json — replayed by every later same-key
   *     submit). A PENDING row whose driver died is resolved THROUGH THE SAME
   *     ROW by the recovering actor (the await-then-take-over).
   *
   *   PR #46 round 9 (the GENERATION-FENCED, IDENTITY-RECOVERABLE boundary —
   *   the three round-8 takeover-protocol corrections):
   *
   *   - GENERATION FENCING: the ledger row carries a generation/fencing
   *     token. takeOver() returns the NEW token, and the resolution
   *     transitions — complete(key, generation, result) /
   *     fail(key, generation, error) — are CAS-fenced against it. A stale
   *     generation is STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE of resolving the operation:
   *     after a take-over, the old driver's success AND its failure both
   *     affect 0 rows; exactly one generation (the ACTIVE driver) resolves
   *     authoritatively.
   *   - THE OPERATION IDENTITY (round 10 — migration 0050's EXPLICIT
   *     LIFECYCLE): the row records the durable provider-side identity of the
   *     ONE operation (provider_operation_handle — migration 0049) ONLY AFTER
   *     the provider CONFIRMED the operation (the IDEMPOTENT-BY-KEY
   *     startOperation submission returned that identity — the state CAS
   *     'pending' → 'started'). The database NEVER infers that a provider
   *     operation happened merely because WorkflowOS persisted an intended
   *     identity. A recovery driver that finds a 'started' row RESOLVES THE
   *     CONFIRMED OPERATION BY ITS IDENTITY — it never re-submits; a 'pending'
   *     row (submission unconfirmed, NO handle — the row claims NOTHING about
   *     the provider) is RE-SUBMITTED under the idempotent-by-key contract,
   *     which is safe whether or not a previous attempt started the
   *     operation (the provider's key→operation mapping is the authority,
   *     never the ledger row). Take-over therefore no longer MEANS "execute
   *     the operation again": the recovery primitive is re-submission-that-
   *     converges (unconfirmed) or resolve-by-identity (confirmed), justified
   *     per provider (the default provider's operations are PURE — resolution
   *     is re-derivation; a future side-effecting provider submits through
   *     the platform's idempotency-key mechanism and resolves by a platform
   *     status fetch), never by an architecture-wide determinism assumption.
   *   - KEY IMMUTABILITY: COMPLETED and FAILED are BOTH terminal. The key
   *     identifies the LOGICAL OPERATION INVOCATION — one key, one operation,
   *     one terminal result. A terminally failed operation is NEVER re-armed
   *     under the same key; retryability is the driver mechanics' concern
   *     (await → take-over → re-submit/resolve-by-identity), never a second
   *     operation silently opened under the same key.
   *
   *   - NATIVE mode: AgentRun is the durable native operation ledger —
   *     `wfos_agent_runs` (migration 0011 — `execution_id TEXT NOT NULL
   *     UNIQUE`). The run row IS the native provider operation (the run
   *     creation + the adapter execution the gateway performs only AFTER its
   *     own run-creation succeeded); the execution_id UNIQUE IS the
   *     operation-key uniqueness (the keyed native dispatch derives its
   *     operation identity from the durable execution identity), and the
   *     run's status/refs ARE the operation result. Process-loss recovery on
   *     the native path is CONVERGE-ON-THE-EXISTING-RUN: a keyed submit whose
   *     run already exists NEVER reaches the gateway (no second run
   *     creation, no second adapter invocation) — around run creation /
   *     adapter invocation, the run row is the durable record whether the
   *     crashed actor's adapter invocation ever ran. PR #46 round 10 —
   *     EXISTING ≠ COMPLETED: the run's status is a LIFECYCLE (pending |
   *     in_progress | success | failed | cancelled), and the convergence
   *     PRESERVES it — a TERMINAL run maps to its terminal submission
   *     (success → completed; failed/cancelled → failed); a NON-TERMINAL run
   *     (pending/in_progress) is AWAITED until terminal (never reported as
   *     completed while still executing); a stuck run fails CLOSED (a keyed
   *     submit never manufactures a completed outcome from a non-terminal run
   *     — nor from the mere existence of the ledger row — and never starts a
   *     second run). The
   *     native ledger's mechanics are deliberately DIFFERENT from the
   *     external ledger's (the native convergence authority is the UNIQUE
   *     constraint on the durable execution identity; the external ledger's
   *     is the generation-fenced resolution CAS + the idempotent-submission
   *     protocol): both arms have a durable operation ledger — they do not share one mechanism.
   *
   * Absent/null (the mainline one-shot dispatch): the provider's pre-WORK-042
   * behavior applies unchanged (a direct generation/dispatch, no registry).

 *     (`wfos_execution_provider_operations`, migrations 0048 + 0049 + 0050):
 *     the ROW is the operation (ONE per key — PRIMARY KEY), the EXPLICIT
 *     LIFECYCLE is PENDING → STARTED → COMPLETED/FAILED (a terminal success
 *     is only recordable for a provider-CONFIRMED operation) + the stored
 *     result; same key always resolves to the same operation. An in-process
 *     Map registry is FORBIDDEN (it dies with the instance).
 *
 *   - native — AgentRun is the durable native operation ledger:
 *     `wfos_agent_runs` (migration 0011) — `execution_id` UNIQUE is the
 *     operation-key uniqueness, the run row is the operation + its result,
 *     and a keyed submit whose run exists converges (never a second
 *     gateway/adapter call). Its mechanics deliberately differ from the
 *     external ledger's (see {@link ExecutionTask.dispatchIdempotencyKey}).
 *
 * PR #46 round 9 (the GENERATION-FENCED boundary) + round 10 (the
 * IDEMPOTENT-SUBMISSION + LIFECYCLE-EXPLICIT boundary): the external
 * ledger's takeover protocol no longer re-runs the operation body.
 * takeOver() returns a NEW GENERATION TOKEN; complete/fail are CAS-fenced
 * against it (a stale generation is structurally incapable of resolving the
 * operation — for a success AND for a failure); the row's EXPLICIT LIFECYCLE
 * (migration 0050 — pending → started → completed/failed) records the
 * provider-CONFIRMED identity ONLY after the IDEMPOTENT-BY-KEY submission
 * returned it (the database never infers a start from a persisted intended
 * identity — a 'pending' row claims nothing and is safely re-submitted; a
 * 'started' row is resolved by its confirmed identity); and COMPLETED/FAILED
 * are BOTH terminal (the key identifies ONE logical operation invocation
 * with ONE terminal result). On the native arm, the convergence PRESERVES
 * the AgentRun lifecycle: EXISTING ≠ COMPLETED — a non-terminal run is
 * awaited until terminal; a stuck run fails closed; a keyed submit never
 * manufactures a completed submission from a non-terminal run and never
 * starts a second run.
 *
 * PR #46 round 11 (the SUBMISSION-ERROR TAXONOMY — DEFINITIVE REJECT vs
