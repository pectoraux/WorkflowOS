/**
 * WORK-042: Cross-Mode Execution Handoff — the public contract types.
 *
 * PRIMARY INVARIANT: ONE logical ExecutionRecord (identity preserved). ONE
 * ExecutionSession (continues the logical execution). ONE AgentWorkspace (per
 * execution). The cross-mode handoff is a SUBORDINATE state transition + an
 * append-only history log. NO second Work Item, NO second workflow, NO
 * second ExecutionService, NO second AgentGateway, NO second session/workspace
 * engine.
 *
 * The handoff is a subordinate correction-chain transition between the two
 * execution modes (native <-> external) for the SAME logical execution. The
 * execution record's `mode`/`status`/`agent_run_id`/`external_session_ref`/
 * `package_json` columns reflect the CURRENT (active) phase; the append-only
 * `wfos_execution_mode_handoffs` row preserves the prior phase's authoritative
 * evidence snapshot so the correction chain remains visible.
 *
 * SCOPE: ONE cross-mode handoff per execution (either native->external OR
 * external->native, NOT chained). Enforced by UNIQUE(execution_record_id) on
 * the handoff log table.
 *
 * The CrossModeHandoffService composes the EXISTING boundaries — it reuses
 * NativeExecutionProvider + ExternalExecutionProvider + ExecutionTaskService +
 * AgentPolicyEngine + ExecutionPolicyService + AgentProviderRegistryService.
 * It is NOT an ExecutionService (it never creates a second ExecutionRecord;
 * it transitions the existing one). It NEVER touches wfos_workflow_*,
 * wfos_verification_*, wfos_reviews_* (no workflow/verification/review
 * mutation).
 *
 * SECURITY: the handoff log table stores NO secrets (previous_package_json is
 * the ExternalExecutionPackage which contains NO secrets per WORK-027). The
 * route accepts NO authoritative fields (executionId from path; projectId
 * resolved server-side; policy decision server-side; audit identity server-
 * side). The handoff tokens (for native->external) use the EXISTING one-time,
 * short-lived, hashed ExecutionHandoffService (no new token mechanism).
 *
 * This file is private to /agents (PLAT-AC-02). The barrel exports the types
 * below; concrete implementations stay in internal/.
