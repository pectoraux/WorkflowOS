/**
 * V2-013 — Self-Hosted Workflow Library (public barrel).
 *
 * Owns (spec/architecture/v2/work-orders/V2-013.md): the first-party
 * WorkflowOS development workflow artifacts (the six frozen procedures as
 * ordinary WorkflowIR documents), their repository/version manifests,
 * self-hosting installation for development environments through the SAME
 * V2-002 installation authority, the safe self-hosting permission
 * boundary, safe first-party execution packaging (V2-015 proof-predicate
 * consumption where a step requires a VerifiedExecutionFact), typed
 * failed-workflow recovery plans, and deterministic evidence
 * reconstruction.
 *
 * Boundaries (V2-013): V2-003 stays the workflow-semantics authority
 * (artifacts authored through its public builder); V2-002 stays the
 * repository/version/install authority (a narrow structural port,
 * type-only); V2-005 stays the Run/evidence authority (type-only run
 * history, no runs created here); V2-008 stays the computer-agent
 * execution authority (never imported — packaging produces typed
 * preconditions); V2-015 stays the execution-proof composition authority
 * (admission consumed verbatim); V2-012 is an independent sibling
 * (nothing imported); the development-governance authority is consumed
 * read-only (the code-pinned core prohibitions are the anti-weakening
 * floor). NO routes, NO migrations, NO new dependencies; no wall clock,
 * randomness, or network.
