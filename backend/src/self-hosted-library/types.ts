/**
 * V2-013 — Self-Hosted Workflow Library: the public contracts.
 *
 * WORK ORDER: spec/architecture/v2/work-orders/V2-013.md
 * WAVE: W6 (sequential). Base: d97a92f8 (canonical main after V2-015).
 *
 * The domain lives at `src/self-hosted-library/` (application-layer pure
 * domain module — the V2-012/V2-015 family precedent). V2-013 owns
 * EXACTLY:
 *
 *   - the first-party WorkflowOS development workflow ARTIFACTS (the six
 *     frozen procedures as ordinary WorkflowIR documents — authored through
 *     the merged V2-003 public builder, never a second workflow model);
 *   - the repository/version MANIFESTS for those artifacts (the mapping
 *     procedure kind → the real V2-002 workflow/version/installation
 *     identities + the V2-003 semantic digest);
 *   - SELF-HOSTING INSTALLATION for development environments: the
 *     composition of the REAL V2-002 authority (create-or-converge +
 *     version-pinned install) — first-party workflows install through the
 *     SAME authority, protocol and pin semantics as third-party workflows;
 *   - the SAFE SELF-HOSTING PERMISSION BOUNDARY: the typed gate that keeps
 *     first-party workflows inside the governance boundary (fail-closed
 *     against a weakened/absent boundary model, the code-pinned core
 *     prohibitions, the merge gate, governance-protected repository
 *     surfaces, and the first-party capability allowlist);
 *   - SAFE FIRST-PARTY EXECUTION PACKAGING: the typed decision that a
 *     pinned first-party workflow may be dispatched for execution in a
 *     development environment — boundary verdict + pin proof + the
 *     V2-015-consumed proof predicates where a step requires a
 *     VerifiedExecutionFact (never a re-implementation: V2-015's admission
 *     result is carried verbatim);
 *   - typed FAILED-WORKFLOW RECOVERY plans (a failed run is never
 *     resurrected in place; the pin never moves silently) and deterministic
 *     EVIDENCE RECONSTRUCTION over manifests + installation facts + run
 *     history.
 *
 * BOUNDARY CONTRACT (load-bearing, pinned by
 * tests/architecture/self-hosted-library-boundary.test.ts):
 *
 *   - V2-003 remains the ONLY workflow-semantics authority (public barrel
 *     consumption; artifacts are ordinary WorkflowIR documents).
 *   - V2-002 remains the ONLY workflow/version/install authority: the
 *     install surface is a NARROW STRUCTURAL PORT (type-only consumption of
 *     the repository service's method shapes — the real service satisfies
 *     it in composition; this module never imports the service and never
 *     re-implements repository semantics).
 *   - V2-005 remains the Run/evidence authority (type-only run-history
 *     data shapes; NO runs are created, driven, or mutated here).
 *   - V2-008 remains the computer-agent execution authority (never
 *     imported — packaging produces typed precondition packages, never
 *     executes).
 *   - V2-015 remains the execution-proof composition authority: proof
 *     predicates are consumed through `evaluateProofAdmission` (the merged
 *     public barrel) and its typed failures are carried VERBATIM; V2-014
 *     stays the verification authority (types consumed through V2-015's
 *     re-exports only).
 *   - V2-012 (marketplace/collaboration/economics) is an independent
 *     sibling: nothing is imported (first-party/third-party equivalence is
 *     proven at composition over the shared V2-002 authority — IG-005's
 *     later gate).
 *   - The development-governance authority (WORK-051/052, the
 *     architecture-checkpoints substrate) is consumed READ-ONLY: the
 *     code-pinned core self-hosting prohibitions are the anti-weakening
 *     floor the boundary evaluation enforces (ADR-0004: a weakened
 *     boundary file is a validation failure, never a silent pass).
 *   - NO routes, NO migrations, NO new dependencies; no wall clock, no
 *     randomness, no network in the module source.
 *   - REGISTRY CONFORMANCE (V2-CTRL-003): V2-013 introduces NO new
 *     protocol-visible identifiers — every capability in every artifact is
 *     an existing canonical registry name; first-party workflows are
 *     ordinary WorkflowOS workflows on the universal protocol.
