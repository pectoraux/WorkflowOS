/**
 * WORK-064 — Continuous Product Validation: the public domain contracts.
 *
 * The domain lives at `src/continuous-validation/` (application-layer
 * capability OUTSIDE src/modules/, mirroring the §34 benchmark /
 * execution-policy / orchestration / agent-roles pattern — NOT an 18th
 * frozen module). It CONSUMES the existing authorities through their public
 * barrels and owns ONLY the validation-domain semantics:
 *
 *   ValidationJourney / ValidationRun / TestIdentity / Environment /
 *   EffectPolicy / ExpectedObservation / typed ValidationOutcome.
 *
 * BOUNDARY CONTRACT (spec/work-orders/WORK-064.md + the repository mapping
 * note — enforced by static-architecture checks):
 *
 *   - NOT a second identity authority: TestIdentity BINDS an already
 *     authenticated `AuthenticatedPrincipal` (the /auth module's result
 *     type). It never issues credentials, never creates users, never
 *     impersonates humans. Synthetic machine principals only.
 *   - NOT a second verification/evidence authority: validation evidence
 *     REFERENCES rows in the existing /verification module; no
 *     `validation_evidence` store exists here.
 *   - NOT an execution authority: browser execution is WORK-065 (a future
 *     CONSUMER of these contracts).
 *   - NOT a scheduler: triggers are recorded, never fired. WORK-066 owns
 *     scheduling. No timers, no queues, no autonomous loops.
 *   - NO silent-healthy: every failure is a typed outcome with full
 *     provenance (run → journey → step → environment). A missing
 *     observation is an explicit validation_failure, never healthy.
 *   - Fail-closed admission: FORBIDDEN is never executable merely because
 *     a caller requests it; unknown/ambiguous environment capabilities are
 *     rejected.
 *
 * v1.0 remains frozen; this is v1.1-proposed runtime under WORK-064.
