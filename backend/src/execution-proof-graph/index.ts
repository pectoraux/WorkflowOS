/**
 * V2-015 — Execution Proof Graph (public barrel).
 *
 * Owns (spec/architecture/v2/work-orders/V2-015.md): the ExecutionProofGraph
 * model + deterministic serialization, causal/dependency edge semantics,
 * admission predicates based on VerifiedExecutionFacts, cross-device
 * continuation composition preserving Run/WorkflowVersion identity,
 * multi-parent dependency satisfaction, replay/duplicate convergence at
 * graph level, and trust-policy evaluation inputs specific to proof
 * composition.
 *
 * Boundaries (V2-015):
 *   - V2-003 remains the ONLY workflow-semantics authority (never imported
 *     here; semantic digests are opaque binding data);
 *   - V2-005 remains the Run/evidence persistence authority;
 *   - V2-004 remains the node identity/capability authority;
 *   - V2-008 remains the computer-use execution authority;
 *   - V2-009 remains the events/scheduling/placement authority;
 *   - V2-014 remains the cryptographic verification authority (its types +
 *     canonical-JSON/identity utilities are consumed through the merged
 *     public barrel ONLY — never `internal/`);
 *   - V2-012 is an independent sibling (nothing imported);
 *   - NO routes, NO migrations, NO new dependencies; the pure core has no
 *     clock/randomness/network (all injected).
 *
 * The graph is EVIDENCE about executions — never a second workflow,
 * execution, verification, or authorization engine (invariant 12).
