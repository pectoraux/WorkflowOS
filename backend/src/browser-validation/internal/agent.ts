/**
 * WORK-065 — the default {@link BrowserValidationAgent} implementation.
 *
 * THE EXECUTION PATH (spec/architecture/v1.1/validation-model.md §9.3):
 *
 *   admit validation run         (WORK-064 admission — the agent never admits
 *                                 itself; it calls the service boundary)
 *     → enforce EffectPolicy       (before every action — fail closed on
 *                                 FORBIDDEN / mutation-under-READ_ONLY /
 *                                 cross-tenant ISOLATED_MUTATION)
 *     → launch synthetic browser   (the BrowserDriver port — fail closed
 *                                 when no driver is configured:
 *                                 environment_error)
 *     → perform declared journey   (navigate/click/type/extract/screenshot)
 *     → capture observations       (full run→journey→step→environment→time
 *                                 provenance)
 *     → finalize validation run    (WORK-064 finalization derives the typed
 *                                 outcome; the agent never determines health)
 *     → map into /verification     (the EXISTING authority — no parallel
 *                                 store; the agent never creates verification
 *                                 runs)
 *
 * The agent CONSUMES the WORK-064 {@link ContinuousValidationService} for
 * admission, finalization, and evidence mapping. It CONSUMES the existing
 * {@link BrowserDriver} port (WORK-036). It enforces the declared
 * EffectPolicy at execution time. It NEVER mutates code, merges PRs,
 * approves reviews, or transitions workflow state (static-architecture
 * invariant).
 *
 * FAILURE SEMANTICS (never silent):
 *   - rejected admission           → admitted: false, run: null (NO evidence);
 *   - driver unavailable           → environment_error (typed, provenance
 *                                    preserved);
 *   - effect-policy violation      → effect_policy_violation (typed);
 *   - driver timeout/throw          → environment_error (typed);
 *   - selector miss (matched: false) → validation_failure (actual: null);
 *   - missing expected observation  → validation_failure (actual: null);
 *   - partial execution             → completed with captured observations +
 *                                    failures for every unmet expectation.
