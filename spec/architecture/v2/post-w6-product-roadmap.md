# WorkflowOS 2.0 — Post-W6 Universal Product UX Program

**Status:** governed product-layer evolution under `V2-ACR-003`
**Program Work Order:** `V2-017`
**Design authority:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-workflowos-universal-ux-design.md`
**Implementation plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-03-v2-017-universal-product-ux.md`
**Precondition:** Original V2 roadmap W0–W6 and IG-005 are complete.

## Purpose

The original V2 implementation roadmap established the universal workflow protocol, semantic model, execution/runtime system, teaching, scheduling, optimization, ecosystem, verifiable execution and self-hosting. After W6, the remaining product problem is to expose those capabilities through one coherent human-facing experience.

V2-017 is the governed product-layer program for that work. It is presentation and interaction composition over existing authorities; it does not redefine workflow semantics, execution authority, evidence truth, marketplace economics, or development governance.

## Authority model

There is one Work Order authority for this product evolution: `V2-017`.

This document is a program decomposition and dependency/navigation artifact. It does not create independent Work Order identities, semantic authorities, execution authorities, or approval authorities.

- `V2-017` owns product UX composition.
- Existing V2 authorities remain authoritative for Workflow, WorkflowVersion, WorkflowIR, Deployment, Run, Node, Capability, authorization, placement, evidence, teaching semantics, marketplace economics, execution attestation/proof, and governance.
- The existing developer/engineering surface remains an expert workspace, not a replacement product architecture.

## Product model

Primary product verbs:

`MAKE / DO / LEARN / SHARE / IMPROVE`

Primary navigation:

`Home / Workflows / Explore / Activity`

Universal entry:

`Search / Ask / Create`

Primary workflow actions:

`Run / Teach Me / Edit`, with `Schedule` contextual.

Progressive disclosure:

`DO → UNDERSTAND → CONTROL → INSPECT`

The visual grouping above is a product decomposition. Actual task dependencies below are authoritative for implementation sequencing.

### Completion

**T15 — Full verification and product dogfooding**

- Depends on: T2–T14 being implemented at their feature boundaries.
- Provides: final regression, exact-head CI evidence, real browser end-to-end product journey, persisted dogfooding evidence, acceptance-criteria reconciliation and scope audit.

**T16 — Architect gate**

- Depends on: T15.
- Provides: exact-base verification, PR evidence review, sole-architect merge decision and post-merge finalization.

## Implementation sequencing

The program preserves safe parallelism where surfaces are disjoint:

```text
T1
 │
 ├── T2
 ├── T3
 ├── T5
 └── T13
      │
      └── T14

T3 → T4
T4 → T6 → T7
T4 → T8
T4 → T9
T4 → T11
T3/T4/T11 → T12
T6/T7/T9 → T10

T2–T14 → T15 → T16
```

Implementation agents must use the exact dependency relationships above in combination with the V2 control-plane rules. They must not make an unmerged task branch a dependency of another task; when composition requires merged artifacts, composition occurs from current `main` through a dedicated integration gate or the declared sequential boundary.

## Integration boundaries

V2-017 uses the following composition checkpoints:

1. **Shell boundary:** T1 establishes the consumer/expert split.
2. **Workflow boundary:** T3 + T4 establish the primary Workflow mental model.
3. **Execution boundary:** T6 + T7 establish Run, recovery and takeover presentation over V2-005/V2-008 authorities.
4. **Teaching boundary:** T9 composes teaching/reverse-teaching over the same immutable WorkflowVersion.
5. **Trust boundary:** T10 composes Run/evidence/attestation without making cryptographic authenticity equal physical proof.
6. **Ecosystem boundary:** T11 + T12 compose immutable versioning, optimization and marketplace/install behavior without authority drift.
7. **Product gate:** T15 is the final cross-feature product dogfooding gate before T16.

If any composition boundary requires changing an existing semantic or authority contract, stop and raise a separate governed V2 architecture change instead of modifying V2-017's UX layer to compensate.

## Non-negotiable constraints

- WorkflowIR remains the semantic source of workflow meaning.
- WorkflowVersion remains immutable.
- Conversation is input, never the durable workflow format.
- Failed reads remain visibly unavailable and are never converted into successful empty states.
- Purchase/entitlement is never presented as execution authorization.
- Signatures/digests/attestations never become automatic proof of physical side effects.
- Unsupported capabilities are disclosed honestly.
- Existing developer/engineering controls remain reachable.
- No second workflow protocol, workflow engine, execution authority, evidence authority, or verification authority.
- No platform-specific workflow semantics.
- Product terminology may simplify architecture vocabulary but may not change semantics.

## Completion definition

V2-017 is complete only when:

1. all T1–T15 implementation/verification responsibilities have concrete evidence;
2. real browser product dogfooding covers representative creation, review, execution, completion or recovery, teaching, and version/update behavior;
3. the acceptance criteria in `spec/architecture/v2/work-orders/V2-017.md` are verified line-by-line;
4. the final review confirms no frozen authority or semantic drift;
5. T16 receives sole-architect disposition and actual merge evidence;
6. canonical development state is reconciled after merge.

This document is a governed program map, not permission to skip the Work Order, verification, dogfooding, review, or merge requirements.
