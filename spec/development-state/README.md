# Repository Development State — Authority Declaration

`spec/development-state/` is the **canonical machine-readable development-governance
state of the WorkflowOS repository** (WORK-052, Issue #61 §2). It exists so that a
fresh architect or implementation agent with zero conversational history can determine
what architecture version governs, which Work Orders exist and their statuses, what can
run in parallel, which checkpoints apply at which assurance depth, which decisions
constrain the work, and how to resume interrupted implementation.

## Artifacts and their authority

| Artifact | Authority | Changed by |
|---|---|---|
| `governance-model.json` | The governance MODEL: the Engineering Control Loop, assurance profiles + deterministic selection rules + requirement matrix, the governed checkpoint contracts (architecture fitness functions), the self-hosting boundary, the authority map. | Architect only — through a Work Order (GitHub Issue → `spec/work-orders/`) + PR review. Schema evolution is versioned; never edited in place silently. |
| `program-state.json` | The PROGRAM STATE: the governing architecture version record, one record per Work Order (status, dependencies, declared change surfaces, branch/PR bindings, merge evidence, handoff/resumption records, checkpoint outcomes), and the decisions index. | Implementers per the parallel protocol (one branch per Work Item; updated as work progresses); the architect merges. Statuses are evidence-backed (`complete` requires merge evidence). |

**Who may write what:** the governance model changes only through architect-issued Work
Orders; the program state is maintained by the implementing agent of each Work Order
within its declared surfaces and becomes canonical when the architect merges the PR.
Nothing in this directory is a runtime tenant artifact: PostgreSQL (via the existing
modules) remains the authority for tenant project state; the runtime `/architecture`
module remains the per-project ADR/authority; this directory is the self-hosting plane.

## Consumption

- `backend/src/development-governance/` loads and validates both artifacts FAIL-CLOSED
  (schema, vocabularies, DAG acyclicity, evidence-backed statuses, boundary integrity
  against code-pinned core prohibitions, assurance-matrix integrity, enforcement
  references) and answers the control-plane queries.
- `bun run governance:status` (in `backend/`) prints the control-plane summary from a
  fresh checkout.
- The `governance-manifest` detector (7th detector in the WORK-051 closed registry)
  evaluates this state at any exact revision through the architecture-checkpoint
  substrate (`docs/adr/ADR-0006-governance-manifest-detector.md`).

## Validation invariants (enforced by the loader — fail closed)

1. Schema version match (both artifacts); unknown fields rejected.
2. Closed vocabularies: statuses, assurance profiles, surface flags, feedback origins,
   checkpoint kinds, proof classes.
3. The work-order dependency DAG is acyclic and references known Work Orders only.
4. `complete` records carry merge evidence (`pr` + `mergeCommit`); `in_flight` records
   carry a branch (and a PR number once opened).
5. The self-hosting boundary contains the code-pinned core prohibitions (ADR-0004).
6. Each assurance profile's requirements dominate the WORK-051 impact/checkpoint matrix
   at the corresponding impact level (ADR-0002) — assurance adds depth, never subtracts.
7. Every checkpoint contract's enforcement references exist in the repository.

A repository whose development state violates any invariant is NOT a valid governed
state: the control plane refuses to serve it, and the `governance-manifest` checkpoint
detector fails closed.
