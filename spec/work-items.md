### WORK-032 — Native vs External Execution Benchmark
Objective: Build a fair, evidence-driven benchmark that compares native/API and external execution for the exact same engineering task while preserving true provider capability differences.
Requirements: benchmark task snapshots, isolated trials, authoritative CI/verification/review metrics, comparison/export, benchmark integrity.
Dependencies: WORK-031
Execution modes: native and external are both mandatory benchmark dimensions.
Definition of done: Comparable trials prove identical task inputs, prompt digest, and repository baseline, and collect authoritative outcome metrics.

### WORK-033 — Execution Policy and Fair Benchmarking
Objective: Define capability ceilings, benchmark modes, execution policies, and constraint-aware selection without artificially reducing a provider's capabilities.
Dependencies: WORK-032
Core rules: hard constraints first; benchmark quality only ranks eligible candidates; subscription/plan limitations are eligibility constraints; no provider is deliberately handicapped.
Execution modes: native and external remain first-class.

### WORK-034 — Persistent Agent Sessions
Objective: Evolve execution from request/result jobs into resumable Agent Sessions with turns, tool calls, observations, checkpoints, interruptions, and terminal outcomes.
Dependencies: WORK-033, WORK-027
Execution modes: both native and external session state must remain observable through the same logical execution identity.

### WORK-035 — Agent Workspace and Git Worktrees
Objective: Give native agents isolated reproducible workspaces with repository, worktree, branch, baseline commit, filesystem, and execution metadata.
Dependencies: WORK-034, WORK-008
Execution modes: native uses WorkflowOS-managed workspaces; external continues to use provider-native workspaces while preserving the same Work Item/Execution identity.

### WORK-036 — Tool Runtime
Objective: Provide governed tool interfaces for filesystem, terminal, git, package/test execution, browser, HTTP, and related development capabilities.
Dependencies: WORK-035
Execution modes: tool outcomes remain observable for both native and external execution; external adapters report provider-side observations without bypassing WorkflowOS authority.

### WORK-037 — Agent Policy and Permissions
Objective: Add execution-specific policy controls distinct from project authorization: allow, deny, ask, and constrained capabilities for tools, network, secrets, and deployment actions.
Dependencies: WORK-036, WORK-002
Execution modes: policies apply to native execution and to external handoff eligibility/observability.

## 5. EXISTING PROJECTS, CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT, AND MAINTENANCE

### WORK-038 — Existing Project Onboarding
Objective: Allow users to connect software that WorkflowOS did not build and establish an explicit Project Baseline from repository evidence.
Dependencies: WORK-035, WORK-036, WORK-037, WORK-008
Required baseline provenance: observed, inferred, confirmed, proposed.
Execution modes: onboarding-triggered implementation work must support native and external execution.

Objective: Build persistent repository, dependency, architecture, symbol, API, test, runtime, and historical context used to assemble better implementation and maintenance contexts.
Dependencies: WORK-038, WORK-034
Execution modes: context is shared across native and external execution; providers receive the same authoritative task context subject to provider-specific limits.

### WORK-040 — Continuous Development Planner
Objective: Continuously turn product goals, technical debt, refactors, performance opportunities, developer requests, and dependency-aware priorities into governed Work Items.
Dependencies: WORK-039, WORK-032
Execution modes: recommended/selected execution may be native or external per eligibility and policy.

### WORK-041 — Maintenance and Project Health Engine
Objective: Detect dependency vulnerabilities, CI regressions, runtime changes, security advisories, compatibility issues, performance regressions, architecture drift, technical debt, and operational risks; create and prioritize maintenance Work Items.
Dependencies: WORK-039, WORK-040
Execution modes: maintenance Work Items must support native and external execution and the same verification/review lifecycle as feature work.

## 6. ADAPTIVE EXECUTION

### WORK-042 — Cross-Mode Execution Handoff
Objective: Allow one logical engineering execution to move from native/API execution to external execution or from external to native without creating a second Work Item or workflow state machine.
Dependencies: WORK-034, WORK-027
Requirements: preserve logical execution identity, implementation context, evidence, audit, branch/workspace state, and correction history.

### WORK-043 — Execution Eligibility and Constraint Engine
Objective: Determine which execution candidates are actually eligible before performance ranking.
Dependencies: WORK-033, WORK-037, WORK-042
Hard constraints may include: model capability, user subscription plan, quota, rate limits, provider availability, privacy, organization/project policy, native/external restrictions, and security requirements.

### WORK-044 — Adaptive Execution Router
Objective: Recommend or automatically select among eligible native/API and external candidates using benchmark outcomes, quality, reliability, cost, latency, human intervention, and user/project preferences.
Dependencies: WORK-032, WORK-033, WORK-043
Principle: never lower a provider's capability merely to equalize benchmark outcomes.

## 7. MULTI-AGENT INTELLIGENCE

### WORK-045 — Agent Roles
Objective: Model reusable engineering roles such as Architect, Planner, Implementer, Tester, Security Reviewer, Performance Reviewer, UX Reviewer, and Release Engineer independently from any specific provider.
Dependencies: WORK-034, WORK-036, WORK-044
Execution modes: each role may use native or external execution when eligible.

### WORK-046 — Multi-Agent Delegation
Objective: Allow one logical Work Item to coordinate multiple specialized agents while preserving one authoritative workflow and evidence chain.
Dependencies: WORK-045, WORK-035, WORK-037
Execution modes: heterogeneous mixes of native and external agents are supported.

### WORK-047 — Agent Intelligence
Objective: Use historical WorkflowOS evidence to recommend roles, providers, models, execution modes, fallback strategies, and task decomposition.
Dependencies: WORK-032, WORK-044, WORK-046
Hard constraints remain authoritative; intelligence may rank eligible candidates but cannot bypass policy, authorization, verification, review, or GitHub authority.

## 8a. DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE AND SELF-HOSTING

### WORK-051 — Architecture Governance and Checkpoints
Objective: Make architectural conformance executable and continuously enforceable during the existing lifecycle — immutable ArchitectureVersions carry assertion sets; deterministic detectors evaluate exact revisions at lifecycle gates; evidence persists through /verification; no second workflow/verification/architecture authority.
Dependencies: WORK-005, WORK-008, WORK-015, WORK-017, WORK-018, WORK-019, WORK-044
Work Order: GitHub Issue #51 + docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-architecture-governance-checkpoints-design.md

### WORK-052 — Development Governance & Self-Hosting Control Plane
Objective: Make the repository the durable source of truth for the architecture program — the next architecture-version design package (Engineering Control Loop, first-class checkpoints, adaptive assurance profiles, architecture fitness evaluation, governed feedback, self-hosting boundary), the canonical machine-readable development state (spec/development-state/), and the parallel implementation protocol for concurrent stateless implementation agents.
Dependencies: WORK-038, WORK-039, WORK-040, WORK-041, WORK-045, WORK-051
Work Order: GitHub Issue #61 + spec/work-orders/WORK-052.md + docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-development-governance-design.md
Hard prohibitions: no second workflow/Work Item/verification/architecture authority; no chat-dependent state; no provider-specific worker protocol; no mandatory heavy process for trivial changes; no weakened v1.0 security/tenant/concurrency/idempotency.

## 8. DEVELOPER PRODUCT EXPERIENCE

### WORK-048 — Developer Workbench
Objective: Create the primary Stripe-quality developer workspace centered on Project, Work Graph, Work Item, Execution, Changes, Verification, Reviews, Deployments, Maintenance, and Activity.
Dependencies: WORK-040, WORK-041, WORK-042, WORK-044

Objective: Give developers an always-current project health view covering CI, security, dependencies, architecture stability, performance, runtime, maintenance debt, and recommended Work Items.
Dependencies: WORK-041, WORK-048
Execution modes: every recommended maintenance action can enter native or external execution.

### WORK-050 — Unified Execution UX
Objective: Make native/API and external execution feel interchangeable at the Work Item level, including recommendations, eligibility explanations, provider capability, subscription constraints, and one-click cross-mode handoff.
Dependencies: WORK-042, WORK-043, WORK-048
